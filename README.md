# Products Recommendation

This project is one of the project I did during my master's degree. It's a recommendation system for products. It is based on a dataset of more than 7 millions products sold by a fictive shop.  

The primary goal was to analyze the data to extract useful information and split users into several groups.  
The secondary goal was to create a recommendation system.

You have 2 files:
- report: notebook explaining everything I have done (display data, process them, create a recommender)
- user_recommendation: program that takes a client ID and returns stats and recommendations
